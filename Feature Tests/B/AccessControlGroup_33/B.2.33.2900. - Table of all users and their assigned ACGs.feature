Feature: The system shall display a table of all users and their assigned ACGs.---User Assignments

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see the system shall display a table of all users and their assigned ACGs.---User Assignments

    Scenario: B.2.33.2900.: The system shall display a table of all users and their assigned ACGs.---User Assignments
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And  I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "Access Control Groups"
        And I click on "Enable Access Control Groups"
        Then I should see "Enable the Access Control Groups feature?"
        When I click on the button labeled "Enable"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            |Username       |Full Name       |Email                         |Access Control Group  |
